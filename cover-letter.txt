Hello!

My name is Payson Eberz. I'm a computer science senior at the University of 
Texas at Dallas. I've played on hypixel for almost a decade, from playing 
bedwars with friends in middle school to playing ironman skyblock for the 
past couple years. The server has meant a lot to me and I would love to be 
able to help it improve. Over the past couple of months playing skyblock 
I've noticed a lot of small bugs and inconsistencies. In particular, I 
tried to create a calculator for diana drops to figure out when it would 
pay off to upgrade to the next spade tier. While doing so, there was missing 
info in the bestiary, some info that was there was wrong, and the wiki 
hadn't been updated. In the past, I had tried to report some similar errors
through the website but got no meaningful feedback, and I want to make that
system feel better. I saw this opening and would love to be able to help 
people who want to contribute to the server do so by processing their bug
reports and doing testing.

I have some experience with user focused development and general testing. 
Over the summer I worked to create a crossword puzzle website in HTML, JS, 
CSS, and eventually node.js, with Cypress for automated testing. The 
system for doing work was through strict user stories, where everything 
was from the perspective of someone using the site and value had to be 
delivered to the hypothetical user. I think that style of thinking will 
help me identify and process important bugs well.

I am excited for the opportunity, thank you for considering me!
Payson Eberz
