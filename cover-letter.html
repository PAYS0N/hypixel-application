        <div class="cv-text">My name is Payson Eberz. I'm a computer science senior at the University of Texas at Dallas. I've played on hypixel for almost a decade, from playing bedwars with friends in middle school to playing ironman skyblock for the past couple years. The server has meant a lot to me and I would love to be able to help it improve. Over the past couple of months playing skyblock I've noticed a lot of small bugs and inconsistencies. In particular, I tried to create a calculator for Diana drops to figure out when it would pay off to upgrade to the next spade tier. While doing so, there was missing info in the bestiary, some info that was there was wrong, and the wiki hadn't been updated. In the past, I had tried to report some similar errors through the website but got no meaningful feedback, and I want to make that system feel better. I saw this opening and would love to be able to help people who want to contribute to the server do so by processing their bug reports and doing testing.</div>
        <div class="cv-text">I have some experience with user focused development and general testing. Over the summer I worked to create a crossword puzzle website in HTML, JS, CSS, and eventually node.js, with Cypress for automated testing. The system for doing work was through strict user stories, where everything was from the perspective of someone using the site and value had to be delivered to the hypothetical user. I think that style of thinking will help me identify and process important bugs well.</div>
        <div class="cv-text">I am excited for the opportunity, thank you for considering me!</div>
