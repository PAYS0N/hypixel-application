        <div id="intro">Hello! My name is Payson Eberz, I'm a computer science senior. Quick overview if you didn't read the cover letter: I've played on hypixel for a while, and would love to work here making it better. Below are a couple relevant projects; The first is what I did for my job over the summer. The second and third are relevant specifically to hypixel.</div>
        <div id="projs">
            <div class="proj" id="crossword">
                <div class="proj-title">Double Cross</div>
                <div class="proj-description">This is a website I worked on over the summer. My dad works for the local paper making puzzles, and wanted a website version for them. He hired me as a solo dev to create this. We worked in scrum, using Jira and Github to create and manage user stories.</div>
                <a class="proj-link" href="https://software-unseen.github.io/Double-Cross/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play the Double-Cross!</a>
            </div>
            <div class="proj" id="diana">
                <div class="proj-title">Diana calculator</div>
                <div class="proj-description">This is a small tool to calculate expected diana items and money that I used to determine if i should upgrade my spade. It's not particularly complex, but I wanted to include it as it's a big part of the reason I am actually applying.</div>
                <a class="proj-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q_1x-dsqpy049XLS55-p6uWw2BvSGoBVSR5pcK9ugso/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">View the tool</a>
            </div>
            <div class="proj" id="bugs">
                <div class="proj-title">Bug list</div>
                <div class="proj-description">For a bit, I've been tracking bugs I see and writing them down. I started by creating support tickets, but getting no feedback from them discouraged me and I stopped. (This is part of why I'm applying, I want to help make that system feel better.) Since I was applying, I made a little prioritization thing with the list I had so far, this is half attached to show I care and half just to bring some of the them to your attention lol. (The feasibility column is purely guesses, I am unfamiliar with how hypixel mechanically works.)</div>
