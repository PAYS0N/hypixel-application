        <div id="intro">Below are a couple relevant projects; The first is what I did for my job over the summer. The second and third are more specific to hypixel; the Diana calulator made me realize how many small inconsistenies there are with some of the official hypixel stuff (wiki vs bestiary vs what happens in game) and made me want to do quality assurance.</div>

                <div class="proj-title">Double Cross</div>
                <div class="proj-description">This is a website I worked on over the summer. My dad works for the local paper making puzzles, and wanted a website version for them. He hired me as a solo dev to create this. We worked in scrum sprints, using Jira to create and manage user stories.</div>

                <div class="proj-description">This is a small tool to calculate expected diana items and money that I used to determine if i should upgrade my spade. It's not particularly complex, but I wanted to include it as it's a big part of the reason I am actually applying.</div>

                <div class="proj-description">For a bit, I've been tracking bugs I see and writing them down. I started by creating support tickets, but getting no feedback from them discouraged me and I stopped. This is part of why I'm applying, I want to help make that system feel better. Since I was applying, I made a simple prioritization list with what I had so far.</div>
